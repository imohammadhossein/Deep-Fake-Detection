These codes have implemented for  **[Kaggle Deep Fake Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge "Kaggle Deep Fake Detection Challenge").**  There are two main idea behind the story, one is finding the structure of deep fake just by CNN features; second, adding a LSTM network probably will have positive effects on it. 
The sequential procedure are listed down here.

this implementation was among the top ranks in the challenge. the rationale behind the scripts follows two main branches: \
**1- CNN Based Algorithms** \
**2- RNN Based Algorithms**


1- [Crop Faces](https://github.com/imohammadhossein/Deep-Fake-Detection/blob/develop/face_extractor.ipynb "face extractor mtcnn")  \
2- set dataloader \
3- set the network \
4- train the model \
5- set testing situation
