These codes have implemented for  **[Kaggle Deep Fake Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge "Kaggle Deep Fake Detection Challenge").**  There are two main idea behind the story, one is finding the structure of deep fake just by CNN features; second, adding a LSTM network probably will have positive effects on it. 
The sequential procedure is respected inside codes.
this implementation was among the top ranks in the challenge. 


[**Crop Faces**](https://github.com/imohammadhossein/Deep-Fake-Detection/blob/develop/face_extractor.ipynb "face extractor mtcnn") helps to save the videos into sequential frames with your desired interval. the rationale behind the scripts follows two main branches: 

* **CNN Based Algorithms** 
>this
* **RNN Based Algorithms**
